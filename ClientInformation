# 🍽️ FitMeal API – Fuel Your Fitness!

### Simple, smart backend for meal planning and workouts 💪

---

## 🌟 What Is This?

FitMeal API connects to external APIs to fetch:
- Random meals from **TheMealDB**
- Random workouts from **WGER**

It saves the data, organizes it in a database, and makes it easy to:
- Explore new meals
- Track workouts
- Plan healthy habits

---

## 🧠 Why It’s Cool

✅ Pulls real data from external APIs
✅ Lets you save meals and workouts
✅ You can delete/update what you don’t want
✅ Uses login system — so users have their own space (coming soon)

---

## 🔒 Secure & Smart

- JWT login system with roles: `USER`, `ADMIN`
- Admins can see and control everything
- Users will soon only see *their own* content!

---

## 📅 Frontend Coming Soon

This backend will power a future web app:
- Users will log in
- See their own meals/workouts
- Get full weekly plans & calorie tracking
