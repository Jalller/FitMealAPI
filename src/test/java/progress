 Progress Summary: How Far You've Come
You've done quite a lot already! Here's what you've completed so far:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ‚úÖ

Creating meals and workouts (fetching and saving)

Updating meals and workouts by ID and dynamically

Deleting meals and workouts by ID and dynamically

Database Integration (JPA) ‚úÖ

Storing and retrieving meals and workouts

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) ‚úÖ

Using MealDTO and WorkoutDTO for structured data transfer

Fetching external API data ‚úÖ

You are pulling meals and workouts from an external source and storing them

CommandLineRunner for data testing ‚úÖ

The run() method in Main.java is successfully fetching, updating, and deleting meals and workouts

Spring Boot Application Setup ‚úÖ

Your project structure looks good

JPA Entity Scanning ‚úÖ

The @EntityScan(basePackages = "app.entities") is correctly scanning your entity classes

üìù To-Do List
Here's what you still need to do:

Task	Status
JWT Security Implementation (Roles like USER, ADMIN)	‚ùå Not done
Error Handling (Proper status codes & JSON messages)	‚ö†Ô∏è Partially done
HTTP Test File (For manual endpoint testing)	‚ùå Not done
Testing (DAO, Service, Endpoints)	‚ö†Ô∏è Partially done, needs fixing
Deployment (Digital Ocean, Docker, Caddy, HTTPS)	‚ùå Not done
API Documentation (Endpoints, API Hub)	‚ùå Not done
üìå Where Your Code Fulfills Assignment Requirements
1Ô∏è‚É£ CRUD Operations
üìå What it means:
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It ensures that an API can fully manage its data.

‚úÖ Where you're doing it in your code:
CRUD Action	Code Example (from your Main.java)
Create (POST)	mealService.fetchAndSaveRandomMeal();
workoutService.fetchAndSaveRandomWorkout();
Read (GET)	mealService.getAllMeals();
workoutService.getAllWorkouts(); (commented out in Main.java)
Update (PUT/PATCH)	mealService.updateMealById(10L, new MealDTO(...));
workoutService.updateWorkoutById(15L, new WorkoutDTO(...));
Delete (DELETE)	mealService.deleteMealById(20L);
workoutService.deleteWorkoutById(25L);
2Ô∏è‚É£ JWT Security
üìå What it means:
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to secure APIs by allowing authenticated access to certain endpoints.

üöß Status: Not yet implemented. You need:
A User entity with roles (USER, ADMIN)

A JWT filter to authenticate requests

Secure endpoints with @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')") (for admin actions)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling
üìå What it means:
When something goes wrong, the API should return:

A proper HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)

A JSON error message for the frontend to understand

üöß Status: Partially done
You need a @ControllerAdvice class to globally handle errors.

4Ô∏è‚É£ HTTP Test File
üìå What it means:
A .http file lets you manually test API endpoints without needing Postman.

üöß Status: Not done yet.
You'll need to write test requests for all endpoints.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing (DAO, Service, API Security, Error Handling)
üìå What it means:
You need JUnit, Hamcrest, Rest Assured, and test containers to:

Test database queries (DAO Tests)

Test service logic (Service Tests)

Test endpoints (API Tests)

Test security (JWT access)

üöß Status: Partially done, but needs fixing.
I'll now fix your test classes and send them over.

Here's a to-do list for the next few days along with a plan to help you stay organized and meet the deadline by Sunday midnight.

To-Do List
Done
Set up meal and workout classes.

Created DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for Meal and Workout.

Created Services and Controllers for Meal and Workout.

Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Services.

Created Unit Tests for MealService and WorkoutService.

Fixed methods in MealService and MealController for getMealById and getWorkoutById.

To Do
Fix & Comment Code:

Go through each service, controller, and entity.

Add meaningful comments where necessary.

Ensure consistency in naming conventions and code structure.

Add Descriptions:

Add clear descriptions and Javadoc to the methods.

Describe functionality where necessary to ensure readability.

Refactor & Optimize:

Look for any repetitive code or improvements in logic.

Ensure the code is clean, optimized, and easy to understand.

Ensure Tests are Complete:

Write tests for edge cases (e.g., when a meal/workout doesn't exist, when deleting fails, etc.).

Ensure tests are fully passing.

Prepare for the Submission:

Verify that all tasks are completed.

Check if everything is working as expected.

Review all code for clarity and organization.

Create Documentation:

Write a brief summary of what the code does and its functionality.

Make sure it's clear and easy for others (including teachers) to understand.

Day-by-Day Plan (Tuesday to Sunday)
Tuesday (Today):
Complete Remaining Tests:

Focus on ensuring all the test classes (MealServiceTest, WorkoutServiceTest, MealControllerTest) are complete and functional.

Add any missing edge cases in tests (e.g., handling null inputs, invalid IDs, etc.).

Code Cleanup:

Ensure all the code is well-commented, especially complex methods.

Add Javadoc to all important methods to explain their functionality.

Test All Code:

Run all tests to confirm that everything is passing and working correctly.

Wednesday:
Work on Descriptions:

Go through the entire codebase (Services, Controllers, etc.).

Add clear and concise descriptions to methods and classes.

This will improve readability for you and your teachers.

Refactor Code:

Review the code for any improvements, look for places where the code could be optimized or simplified.

Create Any Missing Tests:

If there are missing or weak test cases, add them. Focus on edge cases.

Run all tests after making changes to verify everything works.

Thursday:
Document the Code:

Finish adding all the comments and descriptions for clarity.

Make sure to write meaningful summaries for any complex code and methods.

Final Code Review:

Go through all your classes and check for consistency and proper formatting.

Ensure code style and naming conventions are consistent throughout the project.

Run Tests Again:

Run tests to make sure no functionality was broken during refactoring.

Friday (Mid-Day Deadline):
Prepare for Submission:

Make sure everything works smoothly and the code is well-commented.

Review your code for readability, clarity, and correctness.

Write Final Documentation:

Include a summary of the project: what each class does and any relevant details.

Ensure that the documentation is clear and easily understandable.

Clean Up:

Remove any unnecessary or commented-out code.

Ensure there are no leftover debug statements or unfinished parts of the code.

Saturday:
Final Review and Testing:

Do a final review of your code and the tests.

Check that all functionality is in place and that there are no issues.

If possible, ask a peer or colleague to review the project and provide feedback.

Sunday:
Last-Minute Improvements:

Make any final tweaks based on feedback or your review.

Final Test Run:

Make sure all the tests pass one more time.

Prepare the Submission:

Double-check everything before submitting.

Ensure that all files are in the correct format and location.

Submit by Midnight:

Ensure everything is submitted correctly by the deadline.

Key Milestones for Your Plan:
By Friday (Mid-Day): Code should be well-commented, descriptions added, and all tests completed. This will give you a lot of breathing room before Sunday.

By Sunday (Midnight): Final tweaks, testing, and documentation.

Tips to Stay on Track:
Set Timers: Work in focused intervals (e.g., 45 minutes of work, 15 minutes of break).

Keep Distractions Minimal: Avoid distractions and stay focused.

Take Short Breaks: Take short breaks to refresh your mind and prevent burnout.

Let me know if you need more specific help with anything else! This plan should guide you through the process and help you finish on time with a good quality project.
